           I'm a Full Stack Developer with an engineering background (Bachelor of Electronics and Electrical Communication Engineering, Class of 2020).
            I worked for more than 3 years in the networking field before transitioning into web development, which strengthened my problem-solving skills
             and gave me a solid understanding of system infrastructure.I build end-to-end web applications using Laravel, PHP, MySQL, and React.js from developing
              RESTful APIs to creating responsive and intuitive user interfaces. I focus on writing clean, maintainable code and delivering reliable features such as authentication, role-based access, real-time updates, and optimized database operations. I enjoy solving complex problems, improving user experience, and working in collaborative environments to build scalable, high-quality digital products.
